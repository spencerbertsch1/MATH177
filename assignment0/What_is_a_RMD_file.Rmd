Some new title
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document or RMD. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).



```{r}
# use command-option-i to create a new r chunk, seen here
print('hello world')
?cars
str(cars)
```

We can also easily embed plots in our RMD script! 

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
plot(cars)
```



When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
