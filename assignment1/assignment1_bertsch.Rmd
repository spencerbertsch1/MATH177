**1.  Create three vectors  x,y,z  with integers and each vector has 3 elements. Combine the three vectors to become a 3×3 matrix  A  where each column represents a vector. (1 pt)**
```{r}
x <- c(1:3)
y <- c(4:6)
z <- c(7:9)

# Here we can use cbind to horizontally concatenate the three individual 
# one dimensional vectors. 
m <- cbind(x, y, z)
print(m)
```


**2. Create a vector with 12 integers. Convert the vector to a 4*3 matrix  B  using  matrix(). Please also obtain the transpose matrix of  B  named  tB. Now  tB  is a 3×4 matrix. By the rule of matrix multiplication in algebra, can we perform  tB*tB  in R language? (Is a 3×4 matrix multiplied by a 3×4 allowed?) What result would we get? (1 pt)**
